        I have done Lettcode for more than 4 years. As more and more practice,
        my LC rating gradually increased to 2400+ in one month ago (though sadly
        dropped to 2350+ recently). It seems like although many people ranked
        much higher than me, the blogs related to self-practice are still very
        limited. So I think it’s maybe a good time to share some experience. I
        hope the blog could motivate anyone interested in LC and make
        self-practice a little easier. The post is very limited to my own
        experience and must not be the most effective strategy fitting for
        everyone. If you think it’s helpful, I appreciate it. If you think it’s
        very biased or nonsense, then definitely do practice in your way.

        <a id="What_is_LC_rating_13"></a>What is LC rating
      </h1>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">
        Like many of the contest websites, LC follows the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">ELO system</a
        >. LC rating is a good way to measure the ability to solve problems, the
        higher the rating, the higher chance to solve a problem in a contest.
      </p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="17">
        Technically, problem rating is the rating of a hypothetical contestant
        such that his/her expected rank equals the number of participants who
        solved the problem. In practice, if you meet a problem whose rating is
        equal to your rating, you are expected to solve it in half of your
        contests (<a
          href="https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/46304#:~:text=Technically%2C%20problem%20rating%20is%20the,in%20half%20of%20your%20contests"
          >Reference</a
        >).
      </p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="18" data-line-end="19">
        Thus rating is a good way to make self-practice more effective. Try to
        start with problems close to your LC rating ([your rating - 200, your
        rating + 200]), these problems could be good fits for you. Otherwise,
        they’re either too easy or too hard.
      </p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="20" data-line-end="21">
        Unfortunately, LC doesn’t provide the official problem rating like some
        other websites, for example, codeforce. However, the legendary LC player
        <a href="https://leetcode-cn.com/u/zerotrac2/">@zerotrac</a> does
        provide a LC rating list computed from each contest. Here is the
        <a
          href="https://github.com/zerotrac/leetcode_problem_rating/blob/gh-pages/ratings.txt"
          >github link</a
        >. The rating list is much more precise than LC official tags (easy,
        medium, hard). As mentioned before, practice with problems close to your
        rating may be a good approach.

      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="23" data-line-end="24">
        I hope the answer could be “Yes”. However, unfortunately, from my

      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="26">
        There’re too many factors needed to find a good offer, for example, good
        luck, algorithm skill, presentation skill, system design skill,
        education background, interviewer, or even the weather. Algorithm skill
        is only one of them, though it may be an important one. There’s no
        guarantee or relationship like if I can make my rating higher than X,
        then I can get an offer from company Y. You can get an offer from
        company Y no matter what your LC rating is.
      </p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="27" data-line-end="28">
        But the good news is the higher your LC rating, the higher chance you
        can impress your interviewer (If they asked for an algorithm solving
        session, of course). The statistical data from another legendary player
        <a href="https://leetcode.com/wisdompeak/">@wisdompeak</a> shows that
        the median rating from SDEs who got an offer from FAANG company varies a
        lot. The list below shows more details.<a

        The statistical data are collected from people who are very actively
        practicing in LC and the number of samples is very limited. I believe
        the rating mentioned above should be higher than practice. For example,
        if we can ask every SDEs in Amazon to do leetcode contest, I believe the
        median rating should be below 1900. Because as far as I know, most of
        the SDEs in FAANG company are not practicing in LC very actively :)
      </p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="36" data-line-end="37">
        From my point of view, the data above are kinds like a good indicator or
        the expectation from an interviewer. If you can reach the rating when
        you are doing the interview, you can likely impress your interviewer.
        But again,

      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="39" data-line-end="40">
        Although leetcode is much easier than some other OJ, for example,
        codeforces. Most of the problems could be still tricky for beginners.
      </p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="41" data-line-end="42">
        I think for a beginner, the most important part is to be confident.
        Every gain comes after a great amount of practice. If you want to
        improve your skill, you have to spend some time. Even the most genius
        person still needs to practice and he/she still unavoidably makes
        mistakes.
      </p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="43" data-line-end="44">
        I think keeping a good mindset is the key for beginners. When I first
        start leetcode, I often doubt my ability. Am I too stupid to solve the
        problem? Is it something done wrong by my side? But after some practice,
        I gradually become more and more comfortable with the problems. After I
        solved about 400 problems (I often need to find solutions from
        discussion of course), I can solve 60% ~ 70% of medium problems without
        looking at the solution. I think my IQ doesn’t change over the period,
        the key point is to practice and learn from others’ solutions.
      </p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="45" data-line-end="46">
        It’s totally fine to admit that some problem is a little too hard at the
        current moment. If you cannot solve a problem at this time, it doesn’t
        mean you’re not good at coding or you’re stupid. It only shows that
        maybe you’re not familiar with some concepts or patterns. I think it
        will be a good time to look at the solution, learn the concept, and
        practice with some similar problems.

        example, how to visit a tree by DFS (Preorder visit) or in a BFS way.

        I believe if you can be familiar with all the concepts mentioned above.
        You can at least reach a 1800+ rating. And it’s may enough for Amazon
        interview from the statistical data shown before!

        If the main reason to do leetcode is for seeking new opportunities, I
        think it’s already a good time to start. At this moment, you should
        already be familiar with most of the concepts mentioned above and should
        be comfortable with most of the medium problems. From my point of view,
        I think your algorithm skill should be good enough for most of the
        normal SED roles.

        If you still want to pursue a breakthrough, then you may have to learn
        some “advanced” topics which may rarely be used in routine development.
        I think the 11 topics below may be helpful.

        And of course, you have to practice more and be comfortable with most
        (if not any) of medium problems. At this point, you should be able to
        solve maybe half of the hard problems without looking into solutions. (I
        am not sure, I may be wrong here. And the difficulties of hard problems
        vary a lot). And you need to consider improving your typing speed if
        that’s your bottleneck, I am not kidding.

        Congratulation! If you can reach 2200+ in leetcode, you’re already the
        top 2% players! It’s a big achievement, isn’t it?

      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="102" data-line-end="103">
        To be honest, I am struggling at this range as well. I have stayed at
        the 2200+ rating for about 1 year and just reached 2350+ in very recent
        months. I don’t think I can provide useful suggestions for people
        already in this rating. But from my experience, I think if you still
        want a breakthrough. Then maybe practice in Leetcode is not enough.
        Currently, I start practice problems from Google Kickstart and Code Jam.
        I do know some people with 2700+ ratings. Most of them had some
        professional competitive programing training before. They’re genius and
        focused, and some of them are top players in ICPC. I think if we want to
        improve our rating. We have to be passionate, we have to be focused, and
        we have to be confident. I hope I can reach 2600+ at the end of this
        year. I hope it’s not too ambitious for me.
